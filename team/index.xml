      <description>Technical evangelist that continues to push the envelope and make automation a way of life. The mantra deploy fast, fail fast if needed, but keep moving forward. We want to make the process of taking ideas and startups in a direction that makes something tangible that you can see and interact with quickly. Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get distracted, without time management we can all lose our way. It&amp;rsquo;s important to see results to keep you on track and that is what we are motivated to achieve.</description>
